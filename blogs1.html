            <p>The animated movies have a very long history . Initially , 
                they were considered only for kids but that changed drasyically
                when 'The Lion King' released into theatres way back in 1994 .
                It grossed around 800 million us dollars(at the time of its release) 
                and emerged as the highest grossing movie of that year . Next year 
                in 1995 all things changed with the release of pixar's toy story . 
                It was the first entirely computer-animated feature film and also
                pixar's first . The movie is still considered to be one the best 
                animated movies ever made . It also got nominations in many catagories
                at oscars and won a academy award(it was indeed a very big thing) . 

                </p>Then the year came 1999 , toy story got a sequel . Initially it 
                was considered to be released on dvd only but then the pixar decided
                to release it in theatres . Many thought that it was a foolish decision , 
                amd they thought that this sequel will not work like it's predecessor . 
                But , how wrong they were , It surpassed it's predecessor in each and every
                aspect and proved everybody wrong .

            <p>
                So , after the incident of toy story 2 , people thought that now the time has 
                come to take animated movies seriously and there should be a separate category 
                at oscars for animated movies . This was started in the year 2002 , when 'Shrek' 
                won the oscars for the best animated movie of the year 2001(there was no category
                for best animated movie of the year prior to 2002 , you say) . After this there was 
                a revolutionary change came in the genre of animated movies . Every year more and more 
                number of animated movies are being made and released to compete at oscars and also at 
                box office with other movies . Some of the best animated movies of the last two decades 
                are , Finding Nemo ,The Incredibles , Ratatouille , Up , Wall-E , Rango , Madagascer , 
                Coco , Inside Out , Despicable Me , Frozen , etc . 


            </p>
                Another revolutionary aspect came for the animated movies in the year 2010 when the sequel 
                for the toy story franchise got released . Toy story 3 was the highest grossing movie of the year 2010 . 
                It was also the first time that an animated movie got a nomination for best picture catagory 
                alonside with other live action movies . So , time and time animated movies have proved their potential 
                whether it is box office numbers or at the awards ceremony .
