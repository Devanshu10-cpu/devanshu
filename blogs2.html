            <p>OTT platforms are one of the largest growing sectors of the world . 
                The first ott streaming service was Netflix . It was laumched in the 
                year 1997 . Well initially began as a dvd rental platform over the 
                years it has modified itself into providing original and best content 
                for entertainment whether it is movies or series . Currently , netflix 
                is the biggest ott platform of the world .

                18th century . It was invincible for nearly over 100 years but now 
                it is getting a tough competetion from ott platforms in all respect . 
                Ott platforms have one advantage over movie theatres , it provides 
                entertainment at your door step .

            <p>During the year 2020 , when movie theatres were closed all over world 
                due to covid-19 pandemic , it was a very great opportunity for the ott 
                platforms to grow their business . Movies which were made for theatres , 
                were released on the ott platforms and the number of subscribers of these 
                ott platforms increased significantly . It was a alarming thing for the 
                movie theatre , people have access to severel worldclass entertainment

                of 2021 simultaneously in theatres and in their streaming service HBO Max .
